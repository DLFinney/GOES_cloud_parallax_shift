# GOES_cloud_parallax_shift
Code which adjusts GOES cloud fields for parallax shift, and regrids them.

Developed as part of the DCMEX project https://cloudsense.ac.uk/dcmex/

These are being shared as inspiration for others coding similar problems, and for others to check what has been 
used for my work. The scripts weren't developed specifically for sharing so you may find they are not simply plug and play
but I've done my best to make the steps clear.
